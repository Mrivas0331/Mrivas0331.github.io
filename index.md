### CPSC 120

* Lab 10, Part 2

    I like this lab because it uses a nested loop to check through double vectors. While it was a lot to take in at first, I enjoy the algorithms we made to correctly display each county with its population. Something about creating algorithms that can find what it's looking for makes it one of my favorite labs. Overall it wasn't extremely difficult especially due to the comments made, but even then it still is one of my favorite labs due to its uniqueness at the time.
* Lab 7, Part 2
    The main reason I liked this lab is also because it was fairly difficult at first. The usage of multiple functions was new and unique, and learning how they worked was pretty interesting and difficult. Although I did have some trouble, I enjoyed tracing the inputs through the entire code and seeing why things didn't work when they didn't. Even though this is also a blackjack lab, I enjoyed the difficulty and the incorporation of new material.
* Lab 5, Part 3
    The reason why I like this lab so much is because it was the first lab to really push me to do better. I have done coding for a year prior to this class, but this lab really used those skills and more to be completed. I also like that the comments weren't too specific as to how to go about it, leaving room to think and do as you see fit to see if your method works. Even though everything was condensed into a single main function, it generally was the first difficult lab we had to make taking in user input.
